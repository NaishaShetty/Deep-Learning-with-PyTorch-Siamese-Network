# Deep learning with PyTorch- Siamese Network

# Overview

This project implements a Siamese Network using PyTorch to perform image similarity tasks. Siamese Networks are widely used for facial recognition, object verification, and other applications that require comparing image pairs. The model is trained using contrastive loss and triplet loss to improve its ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar images.

# Features

-Siamese Network Architecture: Utilizes twin convolutional networks to extract feature embeddings from image pairs.
-Loss Functions: Implements contrastive loss and triplet loss to enhance model learning.
-Optimized Training Pipeline: Includes data augmentation, GPU acceleration, and efficient data loading.
-Application Use Cases: Can be used for facial recognition, signature verification, and object matching.
